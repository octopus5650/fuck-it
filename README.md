# fuck-it
Some random-ass python scripts

So, get this. I was rolling down the street in my grandma-mobile, and some fucking loser kid in an Altima pulls up
Now I ain't got the most powerful car ever, it's a damn Lexus. Heavy and not too good in weather.
But, I've got around 100 horses and double his cylinders.

I fucking hit it and he tries. Turns out it wasn;t a he, it was my ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. Kid hops out and tries to beat me down
I just look him in the eye, and yell out
"I'mma need about tree fiddy"

and that's the story of how I found out my ex dated the Loch Ness Monster.
